%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Computers usherred us into this so-called information era. Computers are not
new. Broadly speaking, any 'thing' that assists people in calculation can be
count as computer, or a simpler version, calculator. Computers have really
changed the way we do things. We use them everywhere. And in most situations 
them are fairly easy to use. 

The purpose of this lecture is, however, to 1) reveal the dirty internals of
computers as much as possible, 2) help build an adequate level of appreciation 
of the complexity of modern computer systems, 3) demystify some common incorrect
beliefs regarding computers, and 4) inspire ideas. This lecture aims at a very
general audience. No prior knowledge is required to understand anything.
Absolute newbies, computer lovers, amateur and semi-expert programmers, and 
maybe even computer experts can have some refreshment on their existing
perspectives, if any, regarding computers.
